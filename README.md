## I am a beginner backend-developer

I am 20 years old.  
Now I'm doing a full-fledged study of django. Also, my interests include various bots for social networks that automate the processes I need.  
Please do not judge my projects strictly, I study on my own, as I am not sure that universities are able to teach me what employers need.  
  
Skills: `Python` / `Django` / `JS` / `HTML` / `CSS` /
